# Install Nginx if it not already installed

# Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
# Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
# Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group.
# Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
#     Use alias inside your Nginx configuration
